Running ``uvmcmcfit``
*********************

Assuming ``uvmcmcfit`` has been installed correctly (in this example I assume
it is located in $uvsrc), usage should be as simple as navigating to the
directory where you have placed the \*.fits image, \*.uvfits dataset, and
config.yaml files.  Then run::

    python $uvsrc/uvmcmcfit.py
