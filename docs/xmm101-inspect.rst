Inspecting the Model Results for XMM101
***************************************

It is essential to inspect the results of the model fitting process to ensure
the best-fit model and the associated parameter uncertainties are robust and
acceptable.  ``uvmcmcfit`` provides a suite of visualization routines that will
assist you in this task.
