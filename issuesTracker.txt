bug found in checkvis.uvmcmcfitVis(), which by default uses the keyword option miriad=True

uvmcmcfitVis() calls
uvmodel.replace which calls
uvmodel.getVis which calls
uvutil.uvload which defines the dim of uu based on only nfreq
- in which if nfreq > 1, then there is no conflict
- However, nfreq is often 1, in which the dim of uu would be 3: (nvis X nspw X npol)

but later model_complex.reshape in getVis reshape the model into this dim of uu
causing mismatch in array size in writeVis(miriad=True), which only depends on NAXIS
    for NAXIS == 7, expects uu.ndim, hence real.ndim to be 4 instead of 3

>> fix adding miriad=True in uvutil.uvload 
>> since this is only a problem when miriad=True in uvmodel.writeVis

Attempt to fix the above issue consistent with uvutil.uvload()

+ comment out changes made in uvuitl.uvload (added option miriad=) which fixed the array size mismatch when calling checkvis.uvmcmcfitVis 
+ Added how to handle the model visibility if NAXIS = 7 following uvutil.uvload:
+ first check if nfreq > 1:
+ if True, it will follow the original way (i.e. 7 axis)
+ else, it will try to force 7 axis, with nfreq-axis being [:], 
+ if it catches the array mismatch which is due to uu.ndim, hence real.ndim = 3 
+ it will make 7 axis, with nfreq-axis begin [0]
