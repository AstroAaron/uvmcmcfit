with checkvis.py

miriad uvmodel cannot handle multiple polarization and spw 
Work around: use CASA mstransform to combine vis-data into one channel, one spw, and one polarization and supply this 'data.uvfits' to checkvis.miriadvis()

# Look at the .uvfits input files for iterFig()
rom astropy.io import fits
im = fits.open('UVmcmc.uvfits')
im[0].data['DATA'].shape


im1 = fits.open('mirvisTEST.uvfits')
im1[0].data['DATA'].shape
----

Problem:
array size mistach between the uvfits made with uvmcmcfit VS miriad

In checkvis.miriadVis()
>> fits op=uvin in=visdata out=datamiriad
if the vis file data have 7 axis, the output miriad vis file only have 6...
# seems like sometimes miriad can handle >1 npol, so I am not sure what is going on even when the nspw and nchannel is already 1

Issue #2

with uvutil.statwt()
- array size mismatch

when there is no spw column in data_real, but NAXIS = 7 in header
data_real.ndim is 3
which sets the dimension of the variable -- wgt 
but NAXIS = 7 in header wants the wgt.ndim to 4
