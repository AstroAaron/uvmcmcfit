XMM101: a single, unlensed galaxy
*********************************

This example shows how to run ``uvmcmcfit`` on the simplest of systems: a
single galaxy that is unaffected by lensing of any kind.

    setup

Configuring config.yaml
-----------------------

config.yaml contains the instructions needed by ``uvmcmcfit`` to initiate the
model fitting process.

Required keywords
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A few house-keeping parameters::

    # Name of the target
    ObjectName: XMM101
 
    # Name of the fits image
    ImageName: XMM101.concat.statwt.cont.mfs.fits

    # Name of the uvfits visibility data
    UVData: XMM101.concat.statwt.cont.uvfits
    
    # Number of walkers
    Nwalkers: 24

.. caution:: The number of walkers used by emcee must be more than double the number of parameters).  In this case, there are only 6 parameters, so the minimum number of walkers is 12.  I selected 24 to be on the safe side.

You must define at least one region.  The first region should be named
``Region0``, the second ``Region1``, etc.  Pay attention to the indentation;
the remaining keywords must be indented to indicate they are sub-components of
``Region0``::

    # First region
    Region0:

        # Right Ascension and Declination center of the model image (degrees)::
        RACentroid: 36.449395
        DecCentroid: -4.2974618

        # Factor by which to increase resolution of model image (integer)
        Oversample: 1

        # Angular radial extent of the model image (arcsec)
        RadialExtent: 1.5

        # Source0
        Source0:

            # total intrinsic flux density
            IntrinsicFlux:
                Limits: [1.0, 5.0, 10.0, 25.0]

            # effective radius of elliptical Gaussian [sqrt(a*b)] (arcsec)
            EffectiveRadius:
                Limits: [0.01, 0.01, 1.2, 1.2]

            # Offset in RA and Dec from RACentroid and DecCentroid (arcseconds)
            DeltaRA:
                Limits: [-0.4, -0.2, 0.2, 0.4]
            DeltaDec:
                Limits: [-0.4, -0.2, 0.2, 0.4]

            # axial ratio = semi-minor axis / semi-major axis
            AxialRatio:
                Limits: [0.2, 0.3, 1.0, 1.0]

            # position angle (degrees east of north)
            PositionAngle:
                Limits: [0.0, 0.0, 180.0, 180.0]
      

Optional keywords
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, the maximum likelihood estimate is used to measure the goodness of
fit.  Alternatively, you may use the chi-squared value as the goodness of the
fit via::

    # Goodness of fit measurement
    LogLike: chi2

By default, parallel processing is not used.  To use parallel processing on a
single machine, set the Nthreads variable to a number greater than 1.  For
example, ::

    # Number of threads for multi-processing on a single computer
    Nthreads: 2

If you have access to a computer cluster with many compute cores, you can use
Message Passing Interface to greatly speed up the modeling process::

    # Use Message Passing Interface
    MPI: True
    Nthreads: 1

.. caution:: Nthreads must be equal to 1 if using MPI!

If you want to compare the model results with an image obtained at another
wavelength (e.g., an *HST* image), you must specify the location of the
alternative image as well as the telescope and filter used to obtain the
image::

    # Alternative image name (used only for comparing with best-fit model)
    OpticalImage: XMM101_F110W.fits

    # Telescope and filter of alternative image    
    OpticalTag: HST F110W
