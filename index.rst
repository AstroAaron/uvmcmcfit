Welcome to ``uvmcmcfit``'s documentation!
=========================================

``uvmcmcfit`` is Python software designed to allow users to fit parametric
models to interferometric data.  It is ideally suited to extract the maximum
amount of information from marginally resolved observations with
interferometers like the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), Submillimeter
Array (SMA), and Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI).

``uvmcmcfit`` has been thoroughly tested on continuum imaging from ALMA
(Bussmann et al., in prep.) and SMA (Bussmann et al. 2012, 2013).  It has also
been tested on spectral line imaging from PdBI (Oteo Gomez et al. in prep.) and
SMA (Bradli et al., in prep.).
